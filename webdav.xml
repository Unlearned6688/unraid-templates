  <Overview>"A simple and standalone WebDAV server." -- created by hacdias on github.com&#xD;
&#xD;
This is just a very simple, set it up in like 2 minutes WebDAV server that I found and made this (also very simple) .xml to use it in unRAID.&#xD;
&#xD;
Disclaimer: Anything beyond this .xml, such as stricter security, etc. will be found on the creator's github. I can't promise anything else will work. I haven't tried it. Also, the creator has nothing to do with my template here. If you find yourself with questions or issues, keep that in mind.&#xD;
&#xD;
Setup:&#xD;
- set the location for the config.yml file (defaults to the /appdata dir where docker configs are stored in unraid typically). add the below (linked) config.yml file to this directory. note: it's a fully filled in example. your real config.yml may omit a lot of the settings!&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
- set the location for your data. (defaults to a new share called "webdav." I do not recommend putting this share under appdata because this is where all your data, game saves, roms, whatever you're saving, will be saved to. It will take a bunch of storage space if you are actually using this webdav. It doesn't have to be its own share (maybe under /data/webdav for example) it's up you)</Overview>
